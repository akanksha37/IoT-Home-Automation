# How to add Particle Device ID and Token

Since this data is sensitive I had to make sure that Iâ€™m not releasing to the public the Token. Otherwise everybody would start to open and close my garage :) 

To add your own Device ID and Token. You have to ad a plist to the project with two String Keys. Named:

- token
- deviceID

and of course add the appropriate value. Save the file and compile :)
